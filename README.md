# Fuzzy Logic
## Assignment 2 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

You are given Mahasiswa.xls containing data of 100 students with two attributes: Penghasilan (Monthly income, real number) and Pengeluaran (Monthly expenses, real number) of a family and the unit is millions IDR.
Build a fuzzy logic based system to select 20 students who are eligible for registration fee assistance of 50%. The system reads the input file Mahasiswa.xls and outputs a Bantuan.xls file which contains one column vector containing 20 rows of integer-valued numbers (whole numbers) that represent the row / record numbers (1-100) in the Mahasiswa.xls file.

Things you must observe:
* Number and Linguistic Names for each input
* Shape and Range of Input Membership Functions
* Inference Rules
* Defuzzification Method
* Shape dan Range of Output Membership Functions (as appropriate with your chosen defuzzification method)

Processes you need to build (can be functions/procedures):
* Read file
* Fuzzification
* Inference
* Defuzzification

Output from your sistem a Bantuan.xls file which contains one column vector containing 20 rows of integer-valued numbers (whole numbers) that represent the row / record numbers (1-100) in the Mahasiswa.xls file.
